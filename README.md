# Wine Quality Analysis

## Research Question

The goal of this project is to determine whether wine quality (a subjective score based on sensory evaluation) can be predicted on the basis of physiochemical properties. 

## Data

The two datasets used for this project are publicly available from the [UCI Machine Learning Archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality), and contain attributes for red and white (respectively) Vinho Verde wines (Cortez et al., 2009).
